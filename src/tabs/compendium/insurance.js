            <h1>Insurance</h1>
            <p>Too many people view life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance and personal liability insurance as a waste of money. They buy too little coverage because they misjudge their true needs. This is tragic because without adequate financial protection against life's random events, you, your family and your wealth are exposed to enormous risk. Bad things happen to good people all the time, and the bad things that happen don't even have to be your fault.</p>
            <p><span>The Insurance section of WealthCompendium will ensure that you are fully aware of the details in your current coverage. It is an ongoing, valuable resource for you whenever and whereever you need it. It will ensure that we review and discuss your coverage on a frequent basis to fill any gaps that may exist.</span></p>
