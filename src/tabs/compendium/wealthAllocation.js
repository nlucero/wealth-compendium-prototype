            <h1>Wealth Allocation</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Most families view their wealth from an investment and asset allocation perspective alone.&nbsp; While this is an acceptable and common approach with investment assets, it may not be the ideal way to view your overall wealth.&nbsp; A proper "Wealth Allocation" allows you to see how each component of your wealth fits in with the others from a goal and risk perspective.</p>
                <p>In the Wealth Allocation we allocate your wealth into three different "buckets."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Personal Risk" bucket includes assets that are intended to preserve your lifestyle, deliver safety and cash flow, and provide principal protection.</li>
                    <li>The "Market Risk" bucket includes assets that are designed to maintain your lifestyle and keep pace with inflation.</li>
                    <li>The "Aspirational Risk" bucket will include assets that are lifestyle enhancement vehicles. We refer to this category as the "get rich" bucket because it entails more risk. Examples of assets typically added here include a closely held business, investment real estate, and concentrated equity positions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is vitally important to families that they see a fully integrated view of their wealth - understanding the risk characteristics of each asset.&nbsp;<span>The Wealth Allocation section of WealthCompendium helps you do just that.</span></p>
